# ripeds

An R data-package for NCES IPEDS data. Instead of crawling the data manually or using the IPEDS package, this package simply keeps stores the data in R data frames for easy access.  All you need to do is load the survey data of choice into your environment, and you are off and running.  In addition, there will be some helper functions to calculate common KPIs, like admit rate, freshmen discount rate, etc.
